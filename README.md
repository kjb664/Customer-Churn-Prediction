# Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project uses a real-world telecom dataset to build a predictive model for customer churn.

## Key Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed data (handled missing values, encoded categoricals)
- Scaled numerical features
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluated with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualized top features impacting churn

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook `Churn_Prediction_Model_Notebook.ipynb`
2. Step through the code cells from top to bottom
3. Review output, visualizations, and model performance
